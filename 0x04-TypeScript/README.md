#### TypeScript

Typescript is Javascript but with an additional layer on top -> *TypeScript's type system*
_It highlights unexpected behaviour in the code_

...

#### Interfaces
At its core, an interface in TypeScript is a *syntactical contract that defines the expected structure of an object*. It provides a way to describe the shape of objects, including their properties and methods, without implementing any functionality. Interfaces solely focus on the structure and type-checking aspects, allowing for better code understanding and validation during development.

- interface syntax
```
interface InterfaceName {
    property1: type;
    property2: type;
    // Additional properties and methods can be defined here
}
```
